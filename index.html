Privacy Policy for My First English Words

**Last updated:** 08/05/2025

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to "My First English Words" (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information related to users of our mobile application, designed to help children (target age 5-7 years) learn English. The privacy of our young users is our highest priority.

## 2. Information We Collect (and Do Not Collect)

**We do not collect personally identifiable information** such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, photos, videos, audio, or persistent identifiers that could be used to track the user across other apps or websites. We do not collect location information.

**Information collected:**

* **Language Preferences:** We save the language chosen by the user exclusively locally on the device to provide the experience in the correct language. This data is not transmitted.
* **Subscription Status (if applicable):** If the user chooses to unlock premium content through a subscription, the status of such subscription (active/inactive) is managed through app store services (Apple App Store, Google Play Store) and a third-party service called Superwall, used to present and manage paywalls and subscription status. We do not directly receive or store payment details or app store account credentials. We may receive anonymous or aggregate information about subscription status through these services.
* **Anonymous Interaction Data (possible, through Third Parties):** Services like Superwall might collect anonymous data about interaction with subscription screens (paywalls) for analysis and service improvement purposes. This data is not personally identifiable.

## 3. Use of Internet Connection

The app is designed to allow access to basic educational content even offline. However, **an internet connection is necessary for:**

* Verifying the status of any active subscription to access premium content.
* Viewing subscription offers (paywalls).
* Making a purchase or restoring a subscription through app stores.

## 4. Subscriptions and Premium Content (Optional)

The App offers additional content accessible through an optional subscription.

* **Purchase Management:** Purchases are processed through the user's account on app stores (Apple App Store or Google Play Store). We do not collect or have access to payment data. The privacy policies of the respective app stores apply.
* **Third-Party Services (Superwall):** We use Superwall's Software Development Kit (SDK) ([https://superwall.com/](https://superwall.com/)) to manage the display of subscription offers and verify subscription status. Superwall may collect anonymous data as described in their privacy policy. We recommend consulting Superwall's Privacy Policy for more details: https://superwall.com/privacy
* **Parental Consent:** In-app purchases must be made by a parent or legal guardian or with their explicit consent, in accordance with app store rules.

## 5. Security

We adopt reasonable measures to protect the limited information we handle. Language preferences are saved locally. For subscription management, we rely on the security of app stores and third-party service providers like Superwall, chosen for their reliability. Since we do not collect personally identifiable data, personal privacy risks are minimized.

## 6. User Rights

Since we do not collect personally identifiable data, requests regarding access, modification, or deletion of personal data are generally not applicable. For questions regarding data managed by third parties (App Store, Superwall), please refer to their respective privacy policies.

## 7. Changes to this Policy

We reserve the right to update this privacy policy. Any changes will be published within the App or on our website and will become effective upon publication. We encourage you to check this section periodically.
