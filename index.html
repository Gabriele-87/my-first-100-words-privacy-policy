# Privacy Policy for My First English Words

**Last Updated:** April 05, 2025

Thank you for using "My First English Words"! This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

Our App is designed specifically for young children (ages 5-7) to learn their first English words in a fun and safe environment.

## Information We Collect

We **do not collect any personally identifiable information** from users of the App. This includes:

*   Names
*   Email addresses
*   Location data
*   Device identifiers
*   Usage data linked to an individual

The only information the App might use locally on your device is related to your preferences, such as the language you select for the App interface. This information is stored only on your device and is not transmitted to us or any third party.

## How We Use Information

Since we do not collect personal information, we do not use it for any purpose. Any non-personal information stored locally (like language preference) is used solely to provide and improve the functionality of the App on your device.

## Information Sharing

We **do not share any information** with third parties, as we do not collect any personal information from our users.

## Children's Privacy

Protecting children's privacy is very important to us. Our App is designed for children and complies with relevant children's online privacy protection regulations (like COPPA in the US and GDPR-K in Europe).

We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If you believe we might have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us immediately so we can delete it.

## Third-Party Services

The App does not integrate with any third-party services for analytics, advertising, or other purposes that would involve data collection.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our associated website/store listing. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
